## Features

- Scalability

Due to its modular architecture, the app can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the app. As the number 
of users increases, the app can be scaled to handle the increased load. The AWS load balancer can be used to distribute the load
across multiple instances of AWS Lambda functions.

- Serverless Deployment

The app is deployed on AWS Lambda, which is a serverless computing platform. This means that the app can scale automatically to handle
